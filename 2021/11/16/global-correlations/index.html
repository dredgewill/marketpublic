<p>Now that we know that world economies are at least somewhat related, what can we do to measure the ‘relatedness’ and compare them? Well, we can use the growth rates in the previous post to calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation">correlation</a> between two indices. The following map shows these correlations:</p>

</iframe>
<p>Now here it gets interesting. It should be quite obvious that countries would have more correlation based on their proximity, most obviously seen in the relatively bolder lines between China and Australia, and between Britain and Europe (although Europe isn’t a country). However, some features stand out.</p>
<p>China appears to have an abnormally low correlation with other countries. Even with Australia, the country with the highest correlation in our small set of five, the correlation is 0.6, noticeably smaller than the 0.7 to 0.9 that most ‘Western’ nations share. Now part of that discrepancy can be excused by the young age of the CSI 300 index, which contributes some volatility. However, it could also be explained by Chinese state control of industries as well as <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jessecolombo/2015/07/12/watch-these-charts-to-better-understand-chinas-stock-market-crash">strict control over the market</a>.</p>
<p>But one part of this doesn’t make sense, if China is so independent, then why does it have a disproportionately higher correlation with Australia? Also, why does Europe have higher correlation with Australia than Britain, their close neighbour?</p>
